i wrote a python script that requests all the pages (1-1000) at store all the
json information in map so later i can use it,
it takes excel format as input which should contain column name as "leetcode id"
it takes all the username's inside that column , and search for same username in map
which holds the information and create a xl sheet which is generated like report
eg. college wise top performers , department wise, class wise

after that i use BS algorithm to find last page of contest  and Multi Threading
to optimise the runtime from 20 mins to 3 mins

*now i am working on  google api connectivity for output files

after that gowreesh integrate it with a mail module that sends the all reports
to the mail id given
