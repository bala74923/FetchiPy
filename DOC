I wrote a python script that requests all the pages (1-1000) and store all the
json information in map so later i can use it.
It takes excel format as input which should contain column name as "leetcode id".
It takes all the username's inside that column , and search for same username in map
which holds the information and create a excel sheet which is generated like report
eg. college wise top performers , department wise, class wise

I have also used BinarySearch algorithm to find last page of contest and Multi Threaded
to optimise the runtime from 20 mins to 3 mins

*Now I'm working on  google API connectivity for output files

automatically to the mail id given by the User.
